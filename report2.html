How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs? We communicated through email and in class.
How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues? There were a few issues with getting the wireframe and content to me, but after that it was good. We comunicated through canvas and in class.
How did you handle publishing your clients sit and sharing it with the client? I copyed the gitlink and sent it to him through canvas
How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub? It was pretty good, but I do not like doing group projects lol</p>
